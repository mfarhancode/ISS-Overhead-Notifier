# ISS-Overhead-Notifier

Developed a Python application that tracks the International Space Station using the Open Notify API and local sunrise/sunset data from the Sunrise-Sunset API. The program checks if the ISS is within ±5° of the user’s location and whether it is dark outside. If both conditions are met, it sends an automated email notification via SMTP. Includes continuous execution with periodic checks using time delays.
